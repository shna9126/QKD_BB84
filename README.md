# QKD_BB84
Project Overview:
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to share encryption keys, making it practically impossible for eavesdroppers to intercept information without being detected. The goal of this project is to develop a simulation of QKD using Qiskit, IBM’s open-source quantum computing framework. The project will cover the implementation of the BB84 protocol, one of the foundational QKD protocols, and will include a simulation of eavesdropping to demonstrate the unique security aspects of quantum cryptography.

Project Objectives:

•	Implement a simulation of the BB84 QKD protocol using Qiskit.
•	Illustrate the impact of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement on secure communication.
•	Introduce a basic eavesdropping attack to demonstrate the resilience of quantum encryption.
•	Analyse the outcomes of QKD under eavesdropping to show the practical advantages of quantum cryptography over classical methods.

Project Scope:

•	BB84 Protocol Simulation: The project will implement the BB84 protocol using Qiskit. The protocol will be simulated between two communicating parties, traditionally referred to as Alice and Bob, for generating and securely sharing a random encryption key.
•	Eavesdropping Simulation: A third party (Eve) will attempt to intercept the quantum communication. The project will demonstrate how quantum properties reveal the presence of an eavesdropper.
•	Data Analysis: Analyse the security implications by comparing the key generated under normal conditions with the key generated under eavesdropping, showcasing the drop in fidelity.
